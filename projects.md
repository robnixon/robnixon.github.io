# Personal Projects

## [Computing Tutor](https://computingtutor.net) - - A website providing free tutorial videos for learning computer science.

I started this project in July 2016 as part of my level 3 extended project qualification.

The idea came from my experience revising for Computer Science exams. When revising it became apparent that there wasn't many good quality websites teaching the content that GCSE and A Level students need to know. I decided to create Computing Tutor to help computer science students who find video tutorials a useful way to learn. The site also provides general tutorials on different Computer Science topics (including programming tutorials) that should appeal to anyone wanting to learn about Computer Science even if they're not taking a GCSE or A-Level qualification.

You can view some of my video tutorials below:

### The Android App
I decided to develop a native Android client for Computing Tutor in order to practice my Android development and Object-oriented programming skills originally acquired whilst studying A-Level Computer Science and also to promote the website to users of the Google Play store.

I used Android Studio, Java and the YouTube Data API to develop the application which is [available to download via the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.computingtutor.robert.computingtutor).
The app is free software made available under the terms of the MIT license. The license, along with the application source code, can be [viewed on Github](https://github.com/robnixon/ComputingTutorAndroidApp).
