# About

Hi, I'm Robert Nixon and welcome to my personal website.
I'm a Computer Science student from Bicester, UK. I enjoy buiding software in my spare time and I'm active in the Green Party of England and Wales.

On my blog, [The Computing Tutor](https://computingtutor.blogspot.co.uk/), you'll find a variety of articles I've written including advice for CS students, opinion pieces and anything technology related that I think others might find interesting.
