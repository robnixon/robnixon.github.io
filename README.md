Hi, I'm Robert Nixon and welcome to my personal website.
I'm a Computer Science student from Bicester, UK. I enjoy building software in my spare time and [I'm active in the Green Party of England and Wales](/politics/).

On my [blog](https://robertjnixon.blogspot.co.uk/) you'll find a variety of articles I've written including advice for CS students, opinion pieces and anything technology related that I think others might find interesting.

I also enjoy solving programming challenges on sites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com). You can view my HackerRank profile [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/robertnixon).
