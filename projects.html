    <!-- Computing Tutor Project -->
    <h3><a href="https://computingtutor.net">Computing Tutor</a> - <i>A website providing free tutorial videos for learning computer science.</i></h3>
    <p>I started this project in July 2016 as part of my level 3 extended project qualification.<br><br> 
    The idea came from my experience revising for Computer Science exams. When revising it became apparent that there wasn&apos;t many good quality websites teaching the content that GCSE and A Level students need to know. I decided to create Computing Tutor to help computer science students who find video tutorials a useful way to learn.
    The site also provides general tutorials on different Computer Science topics (including programming tutorials) that should appeal to anyone wanting to learn about Computer Science even if they&apos;re not taking a GCSE or A-Level qualification.<br></p>

    <p>You can view some of my video tutorials below:</p>

    <!-- Canvass Master Project -->
    <h3>Canvass Master - <i>A mobile application to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of canvassing in first past the post elections.</i></h3>
    <p>
        I developed the first version of Canvass Master for my A Level Computer Science coursework.
        <br><br>
        I thought of the idea whilst overseeing the canvassing process in the
        Green Party. Data from the canvassing session would be entered into a
        spreadsheet after being recorded on canvass sheets and then analysed. I
        realised that if we had an application canvassers could use on their
        mobile phones that allowed them to enter the data about each
        conversation and instantly record it in a database, it would save hours of
        time spent entering data and free up more time for party members to
        talk to more voters and carry out other tasks.
        <br><br>
        The version I created for my A-Level Computer Science was not suitable
        for public release, however I&#146;m looking to develop the app further and to
        release it in future.
